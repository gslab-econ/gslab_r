}
\arguments{
\item{df}{the object to be written, preferably a matrix or data frame. If not, it is attempted to coerce df to a data frame.}

\description{
Load scalars from a text file into global environment.
}
\details{
The function first writes a tag line in the form \verb{<tab:table_name>} to the output file, overwriting if necessary.
The table contents are then written on a new line after this tag. The file is tab-delimited and excludes
row and column names. All values are unquoted.
